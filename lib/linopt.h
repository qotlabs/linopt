/** @mainpage
 * Linopt is a numerical library designed for linear-optical quantum system
 * simulation. The core functions are implemented using C++ to enable efficient
 * performance. The classes  and functions are exposed to Python which enables
 * simple and easy use of the library.
 *
 * The package is designed to simulate the evolution of bosonic states encoded
 * in occupation number basis through a discrete unitary network. The generic
 * scheme of the system is depicted below.

 *
 * The package implements methods for computing probabilities of finding the
 * output state in the fock basis given the defined input state.
 * The implementation allows easy manipulation with the bosonic fock states,
 * the basis state sets and the unitary networks. The package is primarily
 * developed to enable efficient design of linear-optical interferometer for
 * quantum computing purposes. It enables the user to easily compute the
 * postselected output state of a given linear-optical interferometer or deliver
 * the configuration of the interferometer given a precomputed unitary matrix.
