# Linopt

Linopt is a library for linear optics calculations. It consists of C++11 core library and Python bindings to it.

## Getting started

Linopt has the following directory structure:

* `lib` --- C++ library source code,
* `examples` --- examples of C++ library using,
* `pylib` --- Python bindings to C++ library,
* `pyexamples` --- Python example scripts.

### Prerequisites

Linopt uses Eigen library for matrix operations and pybind11 for Python bindings to C++ code. We use Doxygen to generate documentation from the source code comments (in progress).

* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php) --- library for linear algebra.
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) --- library for exposing C++ types in Python.
* [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) --- documentation generator from source code.

### Building
Linopt is likely to compile with any C++11 compatible compiler which is supported by its dependencies (libraries from [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section). We have tested Linopt with the following compilers:

* GCC 7.2 or newer,
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.

We develop Linopt under [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) 18.04 and provide Makefiles for building. To build C++ library you should run `make` command from the `lib` directory. It will generate static version of the library `liblinopt.a`. Type `make help` for a list of available commands. If you want to build Python version of the library go to `pylib` directory and execute `make` in it. If the build is successful Python module `pylinopt.so` will appear. We also provide [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/qt-features-libraries-apis-tools-and-ide/#ide) project files (with extension *.creator) for convenience (however, Qt Creator uses the same Makefiles for building).

## About

### Versioning
We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.

Currently this project is under initial development, so the major version is 0.
